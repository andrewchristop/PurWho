# PurWho

Ever wonder if the person you see in one class is the same person in one of your other classes? Do not fret because PurWho has got your back

PurWho is a simple Python script that parses the BrightSpace class email directory to look for commonalities across two classes. In other words, it checks to see if a person/persons in one class is the same in another.

Below are the steps to get started:
1. Log in to BrightSpace
2. Click the class whose classlist you want to extract
3. Click Classlist
4. Click Email Classlist
5. Save the first classlist as `1.html`
6. Move only `1.html` to the directory `classes`
7. Repeat steps 1 to 4
8. Save the second classlist as `2.html`
9. Move only `2.html` to the directory `classes`
10. Move to the project working directory then execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `python main.py`
11. Enjoy
