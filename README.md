# PurWho

Ever wonder if the person you see in one class is the same person in another? Do not fret because PurWho has got your back

PurWho is a simple Python scraper that parses the BrightSpace class email directory to look for commonalities across two classes. 

Below are the steps to get started:
1. Log in to BrightSpace
2. Click the class whose classlist you want to extract
3. Click Classlist
4. Click Email Classlist
5. Save the first classlist as `1.html`
6. Move only `1.html` to the directory `classes`
7. Repeat steps 1 to 4
8. Save the second classlist as `2.html`
9. Move only `2.html` to the directory `classes`
10. Move to the project working directory then execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `python main.py`
